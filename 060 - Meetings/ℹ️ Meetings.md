The purpose of this folder is to collect information about the meetings that have been held in the form of a database for better processing.

> A meeting is an event of two or more people in which certain information is discussed that should be easily documented.

> Meetings have a property `agendado` which is of type date. In the daily notes, a table appears that shows the meetings whose scheduled date coincides with the title of the daily note, that is, the date.
