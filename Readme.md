## 🎯 Overview

**Obsidian Base Hub** is a comprehensive vault template built on the **KISS principle** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) that transforms Obsidian into a powerful project management system. It provides interconnected databases similar to Notion, specifically designed for managing complex and dynamic work environments[file:40][web:46][web:55].

Unlike team management tools, this system focuses on **individual workflow optimization** while maintaining flexibility for evolving project requirements[file:40][web:53].

## ✨ Key Features

### 📥 Inbox Management
Quick capture system for unstructured notes that can be processed into appropriate databases later[file:40][web:46].

### 📊 Data Management
- **People Database**: Document work relationships and colleagues[file:40]
- **Meetings System**: Organized note-taking and meeting coordination[file:40]
- **Daily Journal**: Track daily work progress and achievements[file:40]

### ⚙️ Work Management
- **Task System**: Break down work into minimal units with global progress states[file:40]

### 🚀 Development Control
- **Projects Database**: Time-bound development initiatives with beginning and end[file:40]
- **Areas Database**: Ongoing permanent work streams[file:40]
- **Centralized Information**: Each project and area maintains its own database for tasks, team members, and meetings without content duplication[file:40]
