The purpose of this folder is to collect information on all tasks from different projects or areas in the form of a database

> A task is a unit of work that produces an increment of some kind in a project or in an area

## Task statuses

The statuses determine the progress of a task from the time it is defined until it is completed. Within the tab of each status you can see a table with the tasks in that state

![[DDBB Tasks.base#Status]]

## Undone

This view of the task database only shows the tasks that have not yet been completed, ordered from lowest to highest level of progress. There is a copy of this view in the daily notes template, which is where it can be most useful.

![[DDBB Tasks.base#Undone]]
